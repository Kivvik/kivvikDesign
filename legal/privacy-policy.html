                <strong>Information collected automatically.</strong>  Like most website providers, we analyse server log files to collect statistical information about how our Sites are used.

                <strong>Log data.</strong> When you use Kivvik, our servers automatically record information, including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you’re using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you visited before coming to Kivvik, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, information about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences, and cookie data. Log data does not contain message content and is not routinely deleted.

            <p class="legalParagraph">
                <strong>Device information.</strong> In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you’re using Kivvik on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.

                <strong>Geo-location information.</strong> Precise GPS from mobile devices is collected only with your permission. WiFi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.

As with the social buttons we cannot prevent these sites, or external domains, from collecting information on your usage of this embedded content.
